//Getting started
Please make sure you have downloaded all the files(including package.json) to a folder. Keep the latest version of Node in your system.

//Open the folder using VS CODE
Open the VS code terminal and in the command line type npm install. This will install all the dependencies and creates a node modules folder.

//Start the App locally
To run the app after node modules have been installed, type npm start in the command line. This will start the app locally and you can work with the app.

//To build and deploy
To deploy the app, kill the terminal and type npm run build in the command line. This will give a build of the application which can be deployed in any server you wish to.
